# Facial Direction Analysis with OpenCV and Mediapipe

This Python script uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to estimate head pose in real-time from a webcam feed. It detects facial landmarks and calculates the head's rotation angles, which can be used to determine if the person is looking left, right, up, down, or straight.
